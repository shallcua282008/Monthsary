    <h2>For My Baby💐</h2>

    <p>Hi Baby,</p>
    <p>I just want to take this time to tell you everything I feel, in the most honest and straightforward way I can.</p>
    <p>First of all, I love you. I love you more than I ever expected to love anyone. And every day, even with the distance, I find more reasons to appreciate you, to admire you, and to choose you. Being in an LDR with you isn't easy, but it’s worth it because it's with you. You make the distance bearable, you make the effort meaningful, and you make every moment special even if all we have are calls and messages.</p>
    <p>I miss you a lot, and what I mean by a lot, I mean every single day. I wanna see you in person, to hug you, to hold your hand, to sit beside you. But even with the distance, my love for you doesn't and will never fade it'll only grow. The more I miss you, the more I realize how important you are to me.</p>
    <p>And Baby, I really need to be honest about something I owe you an apology. Actually, a lot of apologies as always hehe</p>
    <p>I'm sorry for the times I act like a jerk, for being short-tempered and reacting too quickly, for the days when I’m not affectionate or when I sound cold, whenever I go out with my friends without updating you, even though I know how important communication is in an LDR, if sometimes I make you feel like you're not my priority, even though in reality you're one of the most important people in my life, for the moments when I make you doubt yourself. You don't deserve that.</p>
    <p>You're the one who puts in so much effort to understand me, patient with me, gentle even when I'm not. You care in ways I don't always notice right away. And you stay even when distance makes everything harder. I appreciate it so much.</p>
    <p>I know I'm not perfect. I know I can be moody, cold, distant, or careless sometimes. I know I mess things up. Hope you know that I'm trying. I really am. You make me want to be better. Not because you ask me to, but because you deserve someone who tries, someone who chooses you consistently, someone who doesn’t give up when things get difficult.</p>
    <p>And even when things get difficult for us, despite the days when we feel tired or stressed or overwhelmed, I want you to know this that I'm not going anywhere. I'll always be here. I'm committed to you, to us, to the future we're building. I believe in what we have. I believe in our strength as a partner. I believe that one day, all this waiting and missing will turn into something beautiful, a future where we don’t need to check the time zone or count the hours.</p>
    <p>I imagine the day I finally get to see you. The day I finally get to hug you after waiting for so long. The day I can look you in the eyes without a screen between us. The day we can just sit together, quietly or laughing, without worrying about distance. And when that day comes, I know everything will be worth it, every late night call, every “I miss you,” every sacrifice, every tear, every effort, every patience.</p>
    <p>I want you to know that you make me happy. You make me feel loved. You make me feel understood. And even though I don't always show it perfectly, you mean so much to me. I love how you care, how you support me, how you trust me even when the distance makes things confusing. I love how you stay even when I make mistakes.</p>
    <p>Happy 5th Monthsary, my baby girl. Thank you for staying, another month of growing together, learning together, loving each other, and choosing each other even though everything that tries to get in the way. Thank you for being patient with me. Thank you for being strong for us. Thank you for not giving up.</p>
    <p>I know I have a lot to improve on, I promised you, I’m working on it. I'll communicate better (tiniis kita ngayon para dito sorry hehe). I'll control my temper. I'll be more gentle with my words. I'll give you updates without you having to ask for it. I'll show you, that you're important to me.</p>
    <p>You're worth the effort. You're worth the distance. You're worth the wait. And you're worth the love I give every day.</p>
    <p>I love you so much, My Baby Girl Tami. 💐💐💐
